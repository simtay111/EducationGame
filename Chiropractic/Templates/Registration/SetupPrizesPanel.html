    <h4>Standard rewards are already built in.  We will manage everything for you, there's nothing you have to do!<br />
        <br />
        However, if you would like to add some of your own custom rewards (eg: bottle of muscle relief ointment, clinic t-shirt, local business gift card, etc.) you can add them here at anytime.</h4>

        The rewards you are about to setup are what a patient can earn with accumulated game points.  
        <br />
        They will only earn points with correct answers.
        <br />
        Be as creative as you like with rewards.
        <br />
        Here are some guidelines about how to setup your point amounts:
        <br />
        <br />
        Each game has a total of 100 possible points
        (That is 33 points for each of the three game questions).<br />
        <br />
        Rewards can be updated at any time on this page.
        <br />
        500 points = $5.00  You can assign ANY point value you like to your custom rewards.
