Destruction of Records. Upon termination of this Agreement for any
reason, BA shall return or destroy, as specified by CE, all PHI that
BA still maintains in any form, and shall retain no copies of such
PHI. If CE, in its sole discretion, requires that BA destroy any or
all PHI, BA shall certify to CE that the PHI has been destroyed. If
return or destruction is not feasible, BA shall inform CE of the
reason it is not feasible and shall continue to extend the
protections of this Agreement to such information and limit further
use and disclosure of such PHI to those purposes that make the return
or destruction of such PHI infeasible.  -7- 9100767.3

            a. State Law.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require BA to use or
disclose PHI without a written authorization from an individual who

person, where such authorization would be required under state law
for such use or disclosure.

BA agree that amendment of this Agreement may be required to ensure
that CE and BA comply with changes in state and federal laws and
regulations relating to the privacy, security, and confidentiality of
PHI. CE may terminate this Agreement upon [ days] written notice in
the event that BA does not promptly enter into an amendment that CE,
in its sole discretion, deems sufficient to ensure that CE will be
able to comply with such laws and regulations. This Agreement may not
otherwise be amended except by written agreement between the parties.

        <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">
            c. No Third Party
Beneficiaries. Nothing express or implied in this Agreement is
intended or shall be deemed to confer upon any person other than CE
and BA, and their respective successors and assigns, any rights,
obligations, remedies or liabilities. 
        </p>
        <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">
            d. Ambiguities. The
parties agree that any ambiguity in this Agreement shall be resolved

law protecting the privacy, security and confidentiality of PHI,
including, but not limited to, HIPAA and the HIPAA Regulations.
